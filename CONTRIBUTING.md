## Notes for contributors

Feel free to modify the code of gulp-json-srv and make a PR to improve it.

Here are some suggestions and rules that you should follow when doing a PR
* Do PR against develop branch. It's more convenient to me since i'm doing all work here and then merging/publishing new version.
* Ensure that all checks have passed successfully (you may see status of Travis build on your PR page).
* If you can, you should write tests for your new functinality. If you can't, you should try this at least:) Tests allows us to ensure all working in right way.
* to be continued...
